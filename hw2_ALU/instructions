After downloading the files:
  .synopsys_dc.setup file
   design vision script file: dv_script
   test.sv file

Make a work directory:
  vlib work

If vlib is not found, your $PATH is most like broken.
Either edit your .cshrc file to include /usr/local/apps/bin
or execute: /usr/local/bin/getdotfiles to fix it.

Check for syntax errors with the modelsim compiler:
  vlog test.sv

Synthesize the design by running the script within the tool:
Invoke:  design_vision-xg 
Once the tool is up, in the transcript window (design_vision>) below, type:
  source dv_script

Once synthesis is done, click on the "H" box in the "Logical Hierarchy" area.
Then click on the schematic box in the tool bar just under and to the left of
"Design". Double click into the box to see down the hierarchy.
